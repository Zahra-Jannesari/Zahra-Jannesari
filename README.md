# Pourya Mansouri

Hey 👋🏻,

I have worked as an Electrical Engineer for about 4 years but this has made me realize what my passion is as soon as I started coding with python programming language in 2019. Not only could I see my future in it, but also my next best decision when it came to a lucrative career that I can rely on. 

My Compliments to myself were not giving up in addition to enhancing my repertoire in order to make sure that I can be the best version of myself. Python, Django, DRF (Django Rest Framework), Graphql, Web Design, Linux Engineering as well as Docker are my current specialties. I cannot be more thrilled to see myself standing in a great position, a person who paved the way for himself through only a programming language and non-stop and ongoing progress.

My hobbies are sports, reading, walking and working out, swimming and instrumental and concentration music.
